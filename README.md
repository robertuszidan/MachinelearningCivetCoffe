CLASSIFICATION OF CIVET COFFEE AND COFFEA CANEPHORA USING ALGORITHM SUPPORT-VECTOR-MACHINES (SVM) BASED ON ORDE-1 EXTRACTION

Identification of types of coffee beans is a process carried out in determining the types of civet and robusta coffee. The selection of civet coffee manually by the community in determining the type of coffee beans. This makes the process slow and there is no certainty whether the selected coffee stated original civet coffee or a mixture with Robusta coffee, for that it needs to be built a system in identifying the types of coffee beans. In this study the classification technology used for the selection process of Civet and Robusta coffee beans. This research uses first-order feature extraction with SVM algorithm which aims to recognize patterns of civet and robusta coffee beans using texture analysis on grayscale images and feature extraction. In the study, the authors used the Rapid Application Development research methodology to build the system. The results of feature extraction will be an SVM illogical input for classifying the types of civet and robusta coffee beans. The data used in this study were 120 images, consisting of 110 training data images and 10 test data. The results of the accuracy of this method reached an accuracy rate of 87.27% success in identifying the types of coffee beans.
